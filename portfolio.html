                <p>This project was for my CSSE120, Introduction to Software Development, class at Rose-Hulman Institute
                    of Technology. My team used Python to program a robot to perform certain actions based on user
                    input from a graphic user interface (GUI).</p>

                <p>This project was for my CSSE220, Object-Oriented Programming, course at Rose-Hulman Institute of
                    Technology. My team, using Java, created our own version of the arcade game Joust. Some of our own
                    creative choices included the addition of an enemy that could track the player's location and an
                    instructions screen.</p>

                <p>This project was for my CSSE230, Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis, course at Rose-Hulman
                    Institute of Technology. My team, using Java, created our own trip planning application. It used a
                    graph data structure to calculate the best path of travel between each city in the application.</p>

                <h2>Stack Processor</h2>
                <p>This project was for my CSSE232, Computer Architecture I, course at Rose-Hulman
                    Institute of Technology. My team, through a combination of Verilog and schematics, constructed our
                    own stack based computer processor that was designed to carry out a variety of different functions
                    in our own assembly language.</p>

                <p>This project was for my CSSE333, Database Systems, course at Rose-Hulman
                    Institute of Technology. My team, utilizing JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL, constructed an
                    application that was connected to a backend database and allowed users to sign in using RoseFire and
                    browse through the inventory of the climbing club in order to rent out items.</p>

                <h2>Control Solutions Mobile Application</h2>
                <p>This project is still currently being worked on during my during my internship with Rose-Hulman
                    Ventures. We are using React Native to develop a mobile application for both Android and iOS that
                    will be used to communicate via a Bluetooth UART system with a motor controller. This mobile
                    application will be used to configure different settings on the motor controller.</p>
